This paper explores the impact of work-from-home (WFH) on software project management, drawing from a global study involving 297 responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlights significant changes in project management practices, particularly regarding communication, coordination, and the use of collaborative tools. The results indicate that while WFH has provided opportunities for increased flexibility and focus, it also introduced challenges in maintaining team cohesion, project planning, and stakeholder communication. Project delays were a common outcome, with 47.2% of respondents reporting delays due to the shift to remote work. However, improvements were noted in individual tasks, especially in areas like software architecture and implementation. The study also compared the impact on startups versus established companies, finding that startups were more agile in adapting to WFH due to their inherent flexibility. In contrast, larger organizations struggled with slower decision-making processes and coordination. The paper concludes that effective WFH in software project management requires proper tools, formalized coordination mechanisms, and adaptive management practices. These insights contribute to understanding how WFH can reshape software project management and offer guidance for future remote work strategies.
